# CS 281: Intro to Computer Systems

## Lab 07: Condition Codes

#### Overview

The main purpose of this lab is to build a circuit to save a value for later. In
lab 4, you worked in a group to build an ALU which output flags, including the
zero flag, sign flag, and overflow flag. As you are soon to find out, these values
should remain persistent, saved until the next operation occurs. In this lab, you
will choose an appropriate flip-flop and build a logisim subcircuit that saves a
flags value until another operation sets it once more. While the end goal of this
logisim subcircuit will be used in your final project, enough of these sub circuits
connected together results in an 8-bit register.

In the design section, you will apply your knowledge to solve a design challenge.
The lab report should focus solely on your design for the design portion
of the lab, but include truth tables and Karnaugh maps where appropriate.
